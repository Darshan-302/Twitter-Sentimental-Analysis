# Twitter-Sentimental-Analysis

Natural language processing (NLP) techniques were used for this project. I thought it would be a nice idea to find out what Twitter followers thought of the year in December 2020. I merely needed to figure out how to retrieve the information because Twitter users all around the world send over 500 million tweets per day.
This project made use of Python libraries such as Pandas (for data cleaning/manipulation), Tweepy (for mining tweets), NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), TextBlob (for sentiment analysis), MatPlotlib & WordCloud (for data exploration), Emot (for identifying emojis), and Plotly (for some data visualization).
